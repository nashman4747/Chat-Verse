Chat Verse is designed to offer a secure and enjoyable communication experience, and by creating an account, you affirm that you are at least 13 years old and capable of forming a binding agreement. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree not to use Chat Verse for any unlawful, abusive, harassing, or harmful activities, and you must respect the rights, privacy, and dignity of others. We reserve the right to suspend, terminate, or restrict your access to Chat Verse at any time if you violate these Terms or engage in activities that may harm the community or the integrity of the platform. All content you share through Chat Verse remains your property, but you grant us a limited license to store, process, and transmit your content solely for the purpose of delivering our services. We are not responsible for the content shared by users and do not actively monitor private communications.

We are not liable for any damages arising from the use or inability to use the service.
